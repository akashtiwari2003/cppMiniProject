# cppMiniProject
Searching and Sorting Simplified!!

This is basically a C++ console application for educational purpose.

So,Basically what happens is that we learn the searching and sorting algorithms such as linear search, binary search, bubble sort etc. but sometimes it is hard for us to 
remember actually what happens in such algorithms, it becomes hard for us visualize these algorithms.

The purpose of this project is to make it easy for us to visualize how these algorithms works.
Currently this application covers the following algorithms:-

-> Linear Search
-> Binary Search 
-> Bubble Sort
-> Selection Sort

More algorithms will be included in future.
