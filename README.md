Searching and Sorting Simplified!!

Youtube video link for project demonstration:-  https://youtu.be/jxyFcEGQPpY
This is basically a C++ console application for educational purposes.

So, basically what happens is that we learn the searching and sorting algorithms such as linear search, binary search, bubble sort, etc. but sometimes it is hard for us to remember actually what happens in such algorithms, it becomes hard for us to visualize these algorithms.

The purpose of this project is to make it easy for us to visualize how these algorithms work. Currently, this application covers the following algorithms:-

-> Linear Search -> Binary Search -> Bubble Sort -> Selection Sort

More algorithms will be included in the future.
